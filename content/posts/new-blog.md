# "We need a..."

This morning, I awoke to the news that North Korea had fired missiles
over my country. Two things went through my mind:

* Well, I'm glad I was asleep for that.
* How would I build an anti-missile system?

Even now as I write this, I'm slightly surprised by how peaceful Tokyo is
considering we just had missiles fired at us. Missiles! I'm living in 
a real-life version of 
["Missile Command"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Command) and
all I care about how much sleep I'm getting. I am more upset about how
not upset I am.

Anyway, I decided to start "that blog I've been meaning to write". 
Can't always depend on your hostile neighbors to miss after all.

The theme is one I borrowed from work. Being the lone developer in my
company I get asked the think about all kinds of random things. What would it
take to put together a learning portal for soccer skills? Could we
offer data mining to our clients? How much would it cost to run a
streaming Hawaiian music service? Would anyone use such a thing?

I've also been asked to plan out some rather ridiculous things that
I won't mention here. But sometimes I'm not asked about to build something,
I'm merely told "we need a..." and then I just go and make that thing.

This blog will be a collection of "we need a"'s for myself. Generally,
the stuff I get asked to make at work, no one actually needs (which 
explains why we have such crummy sales). The stuff
we really need (like an anti-missile system) no one is asking for (of
course, we already have one... I'm just giving an example). So this blog
will be about stuff that I think we need or at least, stuff that I want.
It is a technology blog detailing my experiments and learning. I hope
North Korea will be kind enough to let me write a few things down before
shooting at us again.
